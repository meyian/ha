Even though I enjoy reading, I've been a gamer for longer than I've been a reader. As in, hardcore in it. When I was gaming it up in the 90s, and aside from games there was nothing else a computer was good for.

There could now be the element of a game to it. I mean, there are more dimensions to move around in than just up, down, left and right on a page. A blog could fight against or alongside you, just like a video game, maybe...
