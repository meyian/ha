What do you think of when you hear the word blog? You cringe, right? But let’s try to put aside the technology. Ignore how bad the user experience of a blog is. I’ll say more about that later, but blogs aren’t exactly sexy things, are they? But being on the other end of one today, I simplified things by just realizing a blog is basically a way to publish yourself. That’s it. You’re a writer and you want to reach your audience? This is how you take matters into your own hands, and self-publish. Tinker around w/ technology for one afternoon on a Saturday, and hey presto, you’re online and in front of billions of potential eyeballs. Who knows, you could be the next Michael Arrington (founder of TechCrunch) or Julie Powell (getting your blog turned into a movie). </p>\n<p>I’ll admit at this point that I always dreamed of being a writer. I loved books and I wanted to write some of my own one day. Have my work published by Picador. I know a blog is not the same thing, but there was a related feeling of literary accomplishment I felt while working on this blog. Never mind how dorky a blog is, it’s still just a way for a writer to get out their ideas.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/content/post_folders/hello_world/1.5/"}}}
