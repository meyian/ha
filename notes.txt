---- Todo ----



	todos

	+ design (pick a font)
	+ start a new gatsby site
	* one page
		+ about modal
    * figure out netlify
    * Add modals for other three links
		- leaderboard modal w/ scroll
			- leaderboard row need up and down
				- w/ ajax
	* submit request widget
		- sending.../sent./request a feature flow
		- basics:
			- textarea w/ submit button
			- clears after submit
			- puts it at the bottom of the list when done
	* make sure it's responsive (works on mobile)
	* pull from firebase
	* post to firebase
	* pull
  When that's done, I have to work on the request a feature
  - leaderboard: twos votes - one on yourself, one on someone else
    - need (throttled) fns that add or subtract votes, add a suggestion
When that's done, Google Analytics
Create a clone as a todo?
	- believe this should be the blank page of any website endeavor. the audience should be a part of the conversation. imagine if facebook was built this way.

Liking programming - it's very abstract.

Right now I've just

It should feel like I'm on all fours, climbing through a gap between rocks in a dark cave with a flashlight between my teeth. If there were the possibility of a camera crew, I wouldn't mind one there, to document the grime on my face and the sweat I'm pouring. But no. All I've done is successfully connected to Postgres from the terminal, using the first password out of three [image] that I could remember. No one will capture moments like this for posterity. I guess I will try to, if no one else finds this stuff interesting.

It's like unboxing something, but needing a week on the set-up instructions.

How tools are a matter of ergonomics, and sometimes, you really prefer using terminal over GUI. for instance, finding my ip address on my mac. (more back and forth)

- finding how to connect using psql
- psql working on first try
- sourcing attempts for the google cloud connection
- external/internal IPs
- checking if i need to refresh to see when my ip address changes
- missing the save button because it's tiny, and i'm high
- closing terminal tabs like I'm biting my nails
- getting the wrong IP
- switching tack after both commands fail

(All along the way are harpies, crying out 'Whaaat? You don't know this already?!!')

We're here to see if we can add our project to netlify, and then try out the netfliy form thing w/ contact use
When that's done, I have to work on the request a feature
  - leaderboard: twos votes - one on yourself, one on someone else
    - need (throttled) fns that add or subtract votes, add a suggestion
When that's done, Google Analytics
